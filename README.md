This Foundry VTT system is inspired by Dark Dungeons, an OGL retro-clone of the Rules Cyclopedia edition of Dungeons & Dragons. Dark Dungeons was written by Blacky the Blackball, capturing the essence of classic D&D while modernizing and streamlining the rules for contemporary gameplay.

The system comes with two themes, which are a light mode and a dark mode.

## Character Sheet
The character sheet can handle any of the core classes and levels up to 24. Monsters and retainers are also supported. Core classes are recognized when entered into the class field, and this will result in the auto-population of various class-related inputs. All auto-populated class-related values can be overwritten if desired.
