## Fantastic Depths - Foundry VTT System
![Foundry v11](https://img.shields.io/badge/foundry-v11-green)![Foundry v12](https://img.shields.io/badge/foundry-v12-green)

This Foundry VTT system is inspired by Dark Dungeons, an OGL retro-clone of the Rules Cyclopedia edition of Dungeons & Dragons. Dark Dungeons was written by Blacky the Blackball, capturing the essence of classic D&D while modernizing and streamlining the rules for contemporary gameplay.

The system comes with two themes, which are a light mode and a dark mode.

## Character Sheet
The character sheets are designed to be flexible and will provide class and level automation for any world-defined classes. Monsters and retainers are also supported. Core classes are recognized when entered into the class field or dragged and dropped from a class item. Setting the class will result in the auto-population of various class-related inputs. Most auto-populated class-related values can be overwritten if desired.
