This Foundry VTT system is inspired by Dark Dungeons, an OGL retro-clone of the Rules Cyclopedia edition of Dungeons & Dragons. Dark Dungeons was written by Blacky the Blackball, capturing the essence of classic D&D while modernizing and streamlining the rules for contemporary gameplay.

## Character Sheet
Taking a minimalist approach, the character sheet can handle any class and level. 
Monsters and retainers are also supported.

## Item Sheet
There are item sheets for adventuring gear, armor, weapons, general skills, weapon masteries, spells and special class abilities.
Many of the item types support temporary, passive and inactive effects that can apply to the owned character, and in some cases the item itself.
